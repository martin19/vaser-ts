VASE renderer for TypeScript

TypeScript port of vase renderer - https://github.com/tyt2y3/vaserenderer -
VASE renderer is a tessellating library for rendering 
high quality 2D vector graphics. 

### about this port 

The code is ported straight from the 
C++ implementation without any further optimizations.
This port is still incomplete but the main tessellation routines
in polyline.ts are tested to be working.
